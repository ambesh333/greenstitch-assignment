## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

https://github.com/ambesh333/greenstitch-assignment.git

Setup Backend

Open a terminal.

Navigate to the server directory:
`cd server`

Install dependencies:
`npm install`

Start the server:
`npm run dev`

This will start the backend server using nodemon, which will automatically restart the server when changes are made to the code.

Setup Frontend
Open another terminal.

Navigate to the client directory:
`cd client`

Install dependencies:
`npm install`

Start the frontend:
`npm run dev`

Usage
Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:5173/.
